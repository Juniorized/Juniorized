I use GitHub to look at other people's projects relating to data science, cyber security, penetration testing, asset discovery, and much more.
Hopefully one day, I'll gather enough research to be able to create my own projects relating to data science.

Technology, security, and safety is things that I think are all important in these present years, and I think that this platform is a great place to learn about things related to that topic.  ðŸ˜‡
