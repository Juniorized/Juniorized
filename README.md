I use GitHub to look at other people's projects relating to data science, cyber security, penetration testing, asset discovery, and much more.
Hopefully one day, I'll gather enough research to be able to create my own projects relating to data science.

I also LOVE books, flowers, dogs, and cats. ðŸ˜‡
